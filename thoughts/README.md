### Thoughts on Provably-True Data

A remote API, such as EtherScan, is excellent. It is easy to use, reliable, generally free, and requires nothing from its end-users other than an unspoken agreement that the responsibility for the integrity of the data belongs to the data provider. We wonder why, in a world of decentralized data that has been consented-to at great cost, one would allow the integrity of the data to escape one's own control. Why use a blockchain to come to consensus, if one is simply going to rely on a third party to gain access that data?

We think, rather, that the decision on where an application's data comes from should be in the hands of the application's developer (or better yet the application's end users). In a web 3.0 world, an application's designer/user should determine how secure his/her data is. Unfortunately, this decision comes with a heavy burden. Those burdens require tradeoffs of data size vs. data speed vs. decentralization. We describe these tradeoffs in this document.
