#### Provably-True Data

We define **provably-true data** as data that is either part of a blockchain block (that is, part of the input to the hash function that produced the block's hash) or was derived in a deterministic way from such data. In other words, **provably-true data** is either directly consented-to by the blockchain or has been derived in a way that can be mathimatically proven to be true. This definition clearly excludes the use of any API that does not provide a proof of its data's derivation.
